//Hal.dll uses a portion of memory between HalpRealModeStart
//and HalpRealModeEnd for stack space when it drops into 
//virtual 8086 mode in HalpBiosCall in order to clear
//screen memory. When it's done it doesn't clean up the stack,
//therefore there is junk data in a portion of hal's .text
//which is 0s on disk. Client compensates for this, but
//it only does so for versions of hal which we've confirmed
//the RVAs for. So this is just to allow us to resolve the
//RVAs automatically whenever we measure hal, so that for
//new hals, we can just go confirm the RVAs before modifying 
//client.
